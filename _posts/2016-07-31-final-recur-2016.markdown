Congratulations to everyone who made it to the group. We were extremely happy to see the response by second yearites. We got to interview some of the most talented coders in our campus and it was a wonderful experience for us and hopefully for them too. We had to reject people only because of limited vacancies even though they were all equally capable.

Here comes the result of Programming and Algorithms Group's second year recruitment test :
