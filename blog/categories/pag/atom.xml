    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This year 3 members from PAG were invited to attend the ACM ICPC Summer Camp 2015 at Amrita School of Engineering. ACM-ICPC World Finalist 2014,2015 and an alumni of PAG, Surya Kiran was a trainer at the camp. Hear each of the attendees speak about his experience.</p>

<p>As I had never been to any such training camp before, this surely was a new experience for me. The camp covered pretty advanced stuff like Treaps , FFT , Suffix arrays , Mobius function and some advanced graph theory topics and many other topics. Everyday we learned some new topics and solved hard problems on those topics. It was great to see how our trainers approached the hard problems (Div1 D,E) and solved problems that required really tricky concepts. This gave me some confidence to try hard problems. After a week long of learning new topics and trying hard problems, CodeChef served us a final contest. The problems were prepared by our trainers who had worked hard all night. And results pretty much showed that the camp was successful. </p>

<p>These kind of camps would be a great experience for anyone who likes algorithms and coding. Personally I feel it was great to see many school students attending camps like these and preparing for IOI. But all this was possible due to the hard work of our trainers. Overall I would recommend going to any such camp, if the opportunity is available.</p>

<p>Picture yourself in a room with a proficient group of people doing what you love to do. Well, that is exactly what I experienced. Being a part of ACM ICPC summer camp at Amrita School of Engineering, Bangalore was a highly motivating and stimulating experience. Getting to solve many medium and hard problems certainly pushed the limits and brimmed the confidence. With just few months left for ICPC, this was essentially the best I could get after missing the winter camp opportunity. Learning many new topics from past World Finalists broadened the vision immensely. A competition concluded the camp with the hope and desire to perform better at the international level. With the awesome campus of Amrita and the city of Bangalore, the camp could not get better. An awesome week full of challenges, inspirations and amazements.</p>

<p>This was a new and interesting experience for me, as I had never attended any kind of training camp before this.The main motive behind the camp was to cover topics which most of Indian competitive programmers are not fluent at, and which do not have very good tutorials on the internet. Some advanced topics were taught, and a number of difficult problems (~ div1 C,D,E) were solved during classes.</p>

<p>The camp was very informative, and it was inspiring to see ACM ICPC world finalists solve tricky problems in front of us, giving us insights on what should be the thinking process while tackling such problems.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This year we have our team 3Spades contesting in the ACM ICPC World Finals’ 14. Last year, IIT Roorkee was proud to having been represented by the team 65th bit comprising of Sharat Ibrahimpur, Tarun Goyal and Dipit Grover. Their team eventually finished 60th, and the first among all Indian teams for that year. We present to you an interview of Sharat Ibrahimpur as he speaks to PAG about what got him interested in competitive programming, where did he get his motivation from, what does it take to become a good programmer and about what students in general should focus on in college. </p>

<h3 id="when-and-how-were-you-introduced-to-programming">When and how were you introduced to programming?</h3>

<p>I was introduced to competitive programming during the end of my third year at Roorkee. Before that for almost an year I was actively solving problems posted on projecteuler.net which gave me a stronghold on math based problems. I was introduced to Project Euler by one of my department seniors while CodeChef was a random accident on the internet. </p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-secret-to-becoming-a-good-programmer">What is the secret to becoming a good programmer?</h3>

<p>The secret to becoming a good programmer is to have a basic understanding of algorithms in almost all the areas. Have a good understanding of few and try to be a master in one. This is pretty feasible. </p>

<h3 id="how-did-you-guys-come-together">How did you guys come together?</h3>

<p>All three of us competed from different teams during 2011-12. Tarun’s team had performed exceptionally well and I heard from many people about Dipit’s problem solving skills. All that was left on my part was to convince these guys to team up with me. They said yes and rest as you know is history :P</p>

<h3 id="when-did-you-start-taking-it-seriously-to-the-extent-of-preparing-for-icpc">When did you start taking it seriously to the extent of preparing for ICPC?</h3>

<p>I started aspiring to perform well in ICPC at the beginning of my fourth year. Though serious preparations began when I failed to perform well in the Kanpur online round during my first attempt. Its good to take failures to your heart when you know you have another attempt left. </p>

<h3 id="who-is-your-inspirationmotivationrole-model">Who is your Inspiration/Motivation/role-model?</h3>

<p>Inspiration? No one in particular. I was motivated by the fact that the best minds across the world will be taking part in this contest. What better way than this to challenge your problem solving skills. 
I have always looked up to the performance of team proof from IIT Delhi. Their team has been a role model to me. </p>

<h3 id="how-much-does-software-engineering-involves-algorithmic-problem-solving">How much does software engineering involves algorithmic problem-solving?</h3>

<p>If you ask me how many problems, that we solve on a day to day basis, are as fancy as the problems you see in the contests then the answer is none. But, if you ask me if algorithmic problem solving skills help in delivering better solutions in your job then the answer is yes.</p>

<h3 id="did-your-deep-interest-in-algorithms-have-any-side-effects-too-like-maybe-affecting-your-cgpa">Did your deep interest in algorithms have any side effects too? Like maybe affecting your CGPA?</h3>

<p>Yup it does have many side effects. CGPA is the one thing that took the hardest blow in my case. During my final exams I had on one hand the choice of studying courses that I didn’t like and on the other I had the option of solving interesting problems. My brain would always convince me to pick the latter. Other things that got affected is the amount of time I spent on arbit things like watching TV series or bakar with friends. You can’t really help it. Everyone gets 24 hours a day. Neither a minute less nor a minute more.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-your-plans-for-the-future">What are your plans for the future?</h3>

<p>The learning curve at Goldman has been a steep one till now. Hoping to gain more work experience from this job. </p>

<h3 id="any-piece-of-advice-for-the-students">Any piece of advice for the students?</h3>

<p>Learn as many skills as you can now. This is the time when the day is all yours as you are not being paid to deliver something. Challenge yourself by doing something productive for long hours every day and then take a break from it to relax. The satisfaction is immense. 
On a side note, many of you might think spending time on quora or reading blogs is better than Facebook as it gives you a feeling that you have gained some precious knowledge. But let me tell you, any piece of knowledge that has not been put to good use is garbage. So don’t acquire knowledge at a pace faster than at which you use it.</p>

    <id>http://pag.sdslabs.co/blog//2014/04/05/codematics-2k14</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the 8th of March 2014, PAG organised an online Maths contest along the lines of Project Euler, <a href="http://erdos.sdslabs.co/">Codematics</a>, as part of the annual Hobbies club fest of IIT Roorkee, Shrishti. It was a 24 hour long competition (March 8 21:00 to March 9 21:00 IST) and was targeted at all the Maths enthusiasts of the IITR campus and the world. The contest had 24 questions - ranging from cakewalk to tricky - that challenged the participants. There was no negative scoring and everyone could make unlimited attempts for each question.</p>

<p>The questions in the contest were based on a variety of concepts from number theory, combinatorics, geometry and some general aptitude and puzzles. And what’s more, we had an overwhelming response. There were more than 100 participants and over 1600 submissions. It was a close contest with three of the participants, Sukun Tarachandani, Priyanshu Seth and Yashpal Choudhary (all from IITR) solving as many as 16 questions, the highest. But the first one to solve them, Sukun Tarachandani was declared the winner of Codematics 2014.</p>

<p>This year the special thing about Codematics was that it was hosted on a new platform, <a href="http://erdos.sdslabs.co/">Erdős</a>. It is an application for math geeks to try out new mathematical problems and keep track of who solves what. The design of Erdős is clean and card-based, with a focus on user-interaction above everything else. This web portal is maintained by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SDSLabs">SDSLabs</a>.</p>

<p>We tried our best to make the contest perfect for you guys, however there were small glitches or misunderstandings in some questions, which were soon fixed. We are sorry for that. Hope you enjoyed giving this competition and we would like to say that we enjoyed even more, putting it up for you. We’ll be back next year with another Codematics and in the meantime we will host more contests on Erdos. </p>

<p>You can still attempt the codematics problems <a href="http://erdos.sdslabs.co/">here</a>. We would love to hear from you. Just drop us a mail at <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#112;&#097;&#103;&#105;&#105;&#116;&#114;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">&#112;&#097;&#103;&#105;&#105;&#116;&#114;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;</a>.</p>

    <id>http://pag.sdslabs.co/blog//2014/03/27/insomnia-2k14</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It has been a busy month for PAG. We have been organizing several contests on the IIT Roorkee intranet as well as online related to programming and general aptitude prowess. But it was the 15th of March that saw the occurrence of most awaited event organized by the group- Insomnia! This was the 5th edition of the annual international programming contest organized by PAG and yes- it lived up to its hype! Organized as part of the annual tech fest of IIT Roorkee, Cognizance, the event was hosted on CodeVillage, an online coding portal maintained jointly by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SDSLabs">SDSLabs</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sdspag">PAG</a>. </p>

<p>For the ones reading about it for the first time, Insomnia is an overnight programming contest held over 12 hours (9 pm IST - 9 am IST) . There are several questions of varying difficulty and each question carries one point (irrespective of difficulty). Ties are broken by the total time taken. Standard ACM-ICPC Rules. This year’s edition saw participation from over 170 teams from around the globe and over 1000 submissions made. If you compare these figures to an average contest hosted on codechef or spoj, they might not sound much to you, but considering the fact that the event was hosted on an independent platform (independent portal and independent grader) with less than half the publicity- we are ecstatic with the results! There were a few glitches we faced (mainly with the leaderboard), but the contest was smooth otherwise. Nevertheless we promise you that we’ll work them out before next year’s edition. </p>

<p>The overall winner of <a href="http://insomnia.cognizance.org.in/user/view_rank/1/10/27">Insomnia 2k14</a> was Mikhail Mayorov, a Russian guy(so no real surprises here!) who contested alone with the team name ‘SADBOYS’. Team ‘good_piggies’ stood second. Kudos to the members Manu Kashyap, Rishav Pati and Sandeep Mohanty! From IIT Roorkee, 4 teams managed a draw with 7 accepted solutions. Sorted on the basis of time, team ‘Invincibles’ came out at the top! Kudos to the members Rishabh Mor, Varun Syal and Yashpal Choudhary!</p>

<p>All the problems have been added on spoj for practice. The editorials for each have also been published and are available <a href="http://ge.tt/3FdSdNS1/v/0?c">here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Team Insomnia</em>: 
<img src="/images/posts/Insomnia/2k14.jpg"></p>

<p>As this post comes to an end, we’d like to say that we hope you guys enjoyed solving the problems as much as we enjoyed putting them up and we hope you’ll be back next year! For those of you who did not compete this year, we hope you’ll turn up next year and tell us what you think about it! We love to hear from you so if you have anything that you’d like to tell us- either about the contest problems, or about codevillage or about Putin taking over Crimea- we are all ears! For any sort of feedback, mail us at <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#112;&#097;&#103;&#105;&#105;&#116;&#114;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">&#112;&#097;&#103;&#105;&#105;&#116;&#114;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;</a>.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a long-awaited winter break comes closer catalyzing our recovery from the haunting memories of a badly screwed up end sem, it’s  good news for the geeks at IIT Roorkee coming after the online prelims of the ACM ICPC Indian Regionals. ACM ICPC is arguably the most reputed programming competition for college students across the world, and seeing Roorkee perform impressively at this huge scale makes us all really proud.</p>

<p>In India there are three sites which play host to the ACM ICPC Regionals: IIT Kanpur, IIT Kharagpur and Amritapuri. There have been a total of 14 qualifications from IIT Roorkee across the three sites this year, a new record in itself for the institute. In the regionals, which will be held around mid December, a total of about 600 teams from the very best technical institutes of the country and abroad shall be competing for their shot at a glorious opportunity of participating in the World Finals of the ACM ICPC. Every year the World Finals are held early July in Russia. This is a great achievement for the programmers and geeks alike at IIT Roorkee; and a record that we should strive to improve every year.</p>

<p>PAG congratulates all the teams that will be representing IIT Roorkee at the Regionals this year and wishes them the very best of luck as they gear up to take on the best in the business.</p>

<p>Here are the team and students from IIT Roorkee who have qualified for the ACM ICPC  Regionals 2013:</p>
