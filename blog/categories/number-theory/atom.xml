<p>Pre-Requisites : None</p>

<p>Explanation :</p>

<p>Any number (lets say A) can be represented in form 4*k+r  (where r can 0 , 1 , 2 , 3). Thus possible values for A^2 is 4*k and 4*k+1 , so sum of two squares can never be of the form  4*k +3 .</p>

<p>N = p1 ^ x1 * p2 ^ x2 * ……  pm ^ xm (prime factorisation of N) can be represented as the sum of two squares if every prime of the form 4*k +3 have even degree (or power) .</p>

<p>This can be proved using following 5 statements :-</p>

<ol>
  <li>The product of two numbers, each of which is a sum of two squares, is itself a sum of	 	two squares.</li>
  <li>If a number which is a sum of two squares is divisible by a prime which is a sum of two 	squares, then the quotient is a sum of two squares.</li>
  <li>If a number which can be written as a sum of two squares is divisible by a number 	which is not a sum of two squares, then the quotient has a factor which is not a sum of 	two squares.</li>
  <li>If a and b are relatively prime then every factor of a^2 + b^2 is a sum of two squares. </li>
  <li>Every prime of the form 4n+1 is a sum of two squares.	</li>
</ol>

<p>For proof of these statements refer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofs_of_Fermat's_theorem_on_sums_of_two_squares">here</a>.</p>
