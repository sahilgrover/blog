    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a long-awaited winter break comes closer catalyzing our recovery from the haunting memories of a badly screwed up end sem, it’s  good news for the geeks at IIT Roorkee coming after the online prelims of the ACM ICPC Indian Regionals. ACM ICPC is arguably the most reputed programming competition for college students across the world, and seeing Roorkee perform impressively at this huge scale makes us all really proud.</p>

<p>In India there are three sites which play host to the ACM ICPC Regionals: IIT Kanpur, IIT Kharagpur and Amritapuri. There have been a total of 14 qualifications from IIT Roorkee across the three sites this year, a new record in itself for the institute. In the regionals, which will be held around mid December, a total of about 600 teams from the very best technical institutes of the country and abroad shall be competing for their shot at a glorious opportunity of participating in the World Finals of the ACM ICPC. Every year the World Finals are held early July in Russia. This is a great achievement for the programmers and geeks alike at IIT Roorkee; and a record that we should strive to improve every year.</p>

<p>PAG congratulates all the teams that will be representing IIT Roorkee at the Regionals this year and wishes them the very best of luck as they gear up to take on the best in the business.</p>

<p>Here are the team and students from IIT Roorkee who have qualified for the ACM ICPC  Regionals 2013:</p>
